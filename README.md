**ANPR for Gate Control**

This project implements an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system using Python and OpenCV. The ANPR system is designed to recognize and verify car number plates in real time, allowing registered vehicles to gain access to restricted areas, such as gated communities or secured facilities. The system captures images or video frames, detects number plates, and compares them to an authorized database, with unregistered vehicles prompted to undergo a registration process.

Features

	•	Automatic Number Plate Detection: Identifies and captures number plates in real-time or from pre-recorded footage.
	•	Duplicate Image Removal: Filters out redundant frames to optimize dataset quality and processing time.
	•	Vehicle Access Control: Verifies registered number plates and automatically grants or denies access.
	•	Customizable Database: Allows easy addition of new authorized vehicles through image uploads.
	•	Sensor Integration: Triggered by sensors (e.g., LIDAR, ultrasonic) to start the recognition process as a vehicle approaches.
